# BetterTeamUpgrades
This is a fork of the popular [TeamUpgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/EvilCheetah/TeamUpgrades/) by [EvilCheetah](https://github.com/EvilCheetah/repo.mods) updating it to the recent R.E.P.O. v0.3.0 version and fixing bugs making it unusable.

## Features & Changes

- This fork currently fixes issues with the original [TeamUpgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/EvilCheetah/TeamUpgrades/) mod causing it to break.
- This fork updates the original out-of-date [TeamUpgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/EvilCheetah/TeamUpgrades/) mod to support the recent upgrade additions including:
    - Player Health Upgrade
    - Player Grab Strength Upgrade
    - Player Throw Strength Upgrade
    - Player Range Upgrade
    - Player Sprint Upgrade
    - Player Stamina Upgrade
    - Player Crouch Rest Upgrade
    - Player Extra Jump Upgrade
    - Player Tumble Launch Upgrade
    - Player Tumble Wings Upgrade
    - Player Tumble Climb Upgrade
    - Death Head Batter Upgrade
    - Map Player Count Upgrade


## Future Plans
- Implement a native late joining system that supports upgrade syncing like the currently broken `LateJoinSharedUpgradesByNastyPablo` mod directly integrated within the [BetterTeamUpgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/MrBytesized/BetterTeamUpgrades/) mod.
- I plan on overhauling the current [TeamUpgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/EvilCheetah/TeamUpgrades/) system or updating the [SharedUpgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/Traktool/SharedUpgrades/) mod to fix the _known issue_ which causes the upgrade to not be applied until level change as the implementation of that mod is probably a better and more flexible approach allowing modded upgrades as well but for now i just wanted a fully working vanilla mod for now so enjoy!

## Issues
If i have missed any upgrades or you find any bugs feel free  to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/W1ll-Gale/better.repo.mods/tree/master) or message me on discord (@`mrbyte.exe`) and i will try my best to fix any issues or update the mod for future updates.
